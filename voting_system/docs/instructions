You must have a server with php running to use these files. I use a basic lamp install and run something like:
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======

sudo /opt/lampp/lampp start
>>>>>>> 441c4f96c687898af969860d3e5846d964b4d289

$ sudo /opt/lampp/lampp start

At the bare minimum, you need an apache server with the files of this repository placed in the htdocs folder.
If you just have an apache server (without lamp), then you will run something like:

$ sudo service apache2 start
(or whatever)

The first file file will be entitled "index.php," so you should be able to follow the flow of the page by starting there.

Once you have the voting_system folder in your htdoc folder and have apache running, you can go to a browers and go to the url:

http://localhost/voting_system/index.php

start up mysql with:

mysql -h localhost -u root -p
